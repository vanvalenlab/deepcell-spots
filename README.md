`deepcell-spots` is a deep learning library for fluorescent spot detection image analysis. It allows you to apply pre-existing models and train new deep learning models for spot detection. It is written in Python and built using [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) and [DeepCell](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf).

## DeepCell-Spots for Developers

Build and run a local docker container, similarly to the instructions for deepcell-tf. The relevant parts are copied here with modifications to work for deepcell-spots. For more elaborate instructions, see the [deepcell-tf README](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf/blob/master/README.md).

### Build a local docker container, specifying the deepcell version with DEEPCELL_VERSION

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-spots.git
cd deepcell-spots
docker build --build-arg DEEPCELL_VERSION=0.11.0-gpu -t $USER/deepcell-spots . 
```

### Run the new docker image

```bash
# '"device=0"' refers to the specific GPU(s) to run DeepCell-Spots on, and is not required
docker run --gpus '"device=0"' -it \
-p 8888:8888 \
$USER/deepcell-spots
```

It can also be helpful to mount the local copy of the repository and the notebooks to speed up local development.

```bash
# you can now start the docker image with the code mounted for easy editing
docker run --gpus '"device=0"' -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    -v $PWD/deepcell-spots/deepcell_spots:/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/deepcell_spots \
    -v $PWD/notebooks:/notebooks \
    -v /$PWD:/data \
    $USER/deepcell-spots
```

## DeepCell Spots Application

`deepcell-spots` contains an application that greatly simplifies the implementation of deep learning models for spot detection. `deepcell-spots.applications` contains a pre-trained model for fluorescent spot detection on images derived from assays such as RNA FISH and in-situ sequencing. This model returns a list of coordinate locations for fluorescent spots detected in the input image.

### How to Use

```python
from deepcell_spots.applications import Polaris

app = Polaris()
# image is an np array with dimensions (batch,x,y,channel)
# threshold is the probability threshold that a pixel must exceed to be considered a spot
coords = app.predict(image,threshold=0.9)
```
