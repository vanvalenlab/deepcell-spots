        p_matrix: matrix with the dimensions (number of cluster)x2, each entry
            is the probability that the detection is a true detection or
            false detection.
        centroid_list: list of coordinate locations of the centroids of each
            of the clusters.
        running_total: list with running total for the number of clusters in
            each image.
        threshold: value for probability threshold for a cluster to be
            considered a true detection.

    Returns:
        list: nested list with length (number of images) with the coordinate
            locations of spots in each image.
