"""Custom metrics for comparison of sets of points
A set of points is an unordered collection of points defined here by a list of the point
coordinates. The metrics defined here quantify the similarity between two sets of points,
taking into account their spatial structure. Specifically, the distance between points is
taken into account (as opposed to the Jaccard distance for example)
